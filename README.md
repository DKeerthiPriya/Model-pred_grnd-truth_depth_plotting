# Plotting the ground truth, model predicted and depth masks on an RGB image
The code takes the RGB image, model predicted mask, ground truth mask and the depth maps of the RGB image as input and gives an image in which all the 3 masks are plotted.

# Sample input and output image:

The ground truth mask is represented in white, the model predicted mask is represented in red and the depth mask in green.
